Solutions of Codeforces Practice Questions

Hi geeks!
I know that this is pretty common that Coders out there submit their code on the platform and upload a copy on Github.
But please allow my own solutions.

I try to code all my solutions in C++17 Language.

PLEASE SEE - I am uploading only accepted solutions and not the rejected ones. So if any solution is missing, then it may be because the problem is not yet done!

*Please ignore the 'a.out' file. It is there because I directly compile the files in the directory where the solutions are stored in my local directory!*
